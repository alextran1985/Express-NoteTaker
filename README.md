SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN I open the Note Taker
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page

WHEN I enter a new note title and the note‚Äôs text
THEN a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page
